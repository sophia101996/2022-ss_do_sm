### Definition of hierarchy

“A system in which people or things are arranged according to their importance”

### What exactly is a hierarchy?

- has its origin in Greek
- each person has his or her precisely defined rights, powers, and responsibilities
- hierarchy can be understood as a pyramid

  - at the top are the highest-ranking people, at the bottom are those with the lowest rank

### Disruptive innovation ideas need flat hierarchies

- enables them to exploit the diverse potential for change in the digital world
- achieve disproportionate output
  - often up to ten times higher than traditional, so-called linear companies

#### Instead of strictly striving for efficiency, the focus today is on rapid adaptability

In order to take advantage of the disruptive potential in a digital world and remain competitive

### What can we take away from this?

- Every organization begins its order with the classic idea of hierarchy
- this hierarchy idea can no longer be implemented well in this way and a different, more agile set-up is required
